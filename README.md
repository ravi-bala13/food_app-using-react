WEB12 Unit 5 Evaluation Pending
Problem
Create a recipe tracking application in react.
App will have 3 sections.
left hand side is used to create a new recipe, it’s a form
every recipe has title, ingredients, time to cook, an image and instructions. any extra thing you want to add is accetable.
user can add the recipe from this form. It gets stored into the mock database.
use any random food image APIs if you want. Eg: API. Or downloading specific images and using them is also acceptable
after recipe is added to DB, it gets shown on right hand side, in a list view.
this section is scrollable, cards format.
Card show only title and cooking time.
Once user click on a card, it’s complete information is fetched and shown below (refer diagram below)
have sorting/filtering feature for cards
use styled components to create basic reusable components. (eg: input boxes, cards etc)
bonus for uploading image files feature. Otherwise using images from URLs is acceptable. (hint: images can be converted into a special format called as base64 which is basically text)
make sure to keep the UI clean, use palette colors, using any UI library of your choice is acceptable.
